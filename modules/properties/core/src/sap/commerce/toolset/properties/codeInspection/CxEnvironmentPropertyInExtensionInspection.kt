/**
 * Reports a property which SAP Commerce Cloud injects per environment being declared in an extension.
 *
 * A `project.properties` file is part of every build, of every environment, so a database URL or a storage account
 * written there hard-codes one environment into all of them. The deployed value wins regardless, which makes the
 * declaration both misleading to read and, for credentials, a secret committed to the repository.
 *
 * `local.properties` is where these belong: it is the developer's own machine, and it is not part of the build.
