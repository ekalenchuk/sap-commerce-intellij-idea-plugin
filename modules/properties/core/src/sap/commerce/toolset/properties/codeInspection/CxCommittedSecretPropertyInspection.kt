/**
 * Reports a secret written into a file which is part of the build.
 *
 * A `project.properties` is committed, shipped in every build and readable by everyone with access to the repository.
 * A password written there is not configuration, it is a disclosure - and deleting the line afterwards does not undo
 * it, because the value stays in the history. Only rotating the secret does.
 *
 * `local.properties` is deliberately not inspected: it is where the other inspections send these values, and saying
 * both "put it here" and "do not put it here" would be no guidance at all.
 *
 * Keys the [CxPropertyRule] catalogue already covers are left to the inspection which owns them, so one line is never
 * reported twice for the same reason.
